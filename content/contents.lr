intro_body:

Open Data Day is an annual celebration of open data all over the world. For the seventh time in history, groups from around the world will create local events on the day where they will use open data in their communities. It is an opportunity to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society.

Hey there Open Data enthusiast! You just saw that International Open Data Day will be on Saturday, 4th March 2018 and will be interested in hosting an event in your locality. Your only challenge now is finding the right idea that will hit the right spot. Our friends from the Open Data community have some ideas and data sources worth checking out.

resources_ideas_theme_1_text:

Use [data.world](https://data.world) to upload or find data from many sources and organize all aspects of a project - including data, notebooks, analysis, and discussions - in a single workspace. Collaborate efficiently using many tools: query uploaded data with SQL, interact with data via R Studio or Python programs using the data.world API, link a Google Sheet to a dataset, or work locally in a spreadsheet and upload a file. After Open Data Day, this work is preserved to showcase what was achieved and permit the community to build upon progress without unnecessarily repeating the data prep and analysis completed on Open Data Day.
